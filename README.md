# Symbiosis

Welcome to Symbiosis, an open-source AI gateway. The goal of this project is
to build a centralized system to connect large language models and image
generation models to applications.

## Goals for the project

### Objective: Provide a centralized environment to access LLMs

We see that providing a centralized LLM gateway with monitoring, cost
management, and proper access controls lowers the burden on teams to develop
high quality LLM-based applications while providing the necessary controls for
our internal IT operations team to manage costs and access to LLMs.

### Objective: Increase safety of our LLM-based applications

Securing LLM-based applications is an important step for every team. But it is
also quite hard to get right. By providing teams with a standardized approach we
lower the burden to secure applications by sharing experience across
applications.
