# Customer personas

This section covers customer personas for the project.

## Persona: LLM Application Developer

We want to focus most of our efforts supporting developers at Info Support who
want to build an LLM based application in Java, C#, Python, or Typescript. The
first three of these are a must while Typescript is a nice-to-have option since
we don't run a lot of applications in this language yet.

Typical developers at Info Support work on their laptop and can login on Info
Support systems. We should make sure that we make it easy to connect to the LLM
application platform, because developers want to experiment rather than spend
time on configuring an LLM connection.

## Persona: System Administrator

At Info Support we have an IT services department responsible for handing out
access to software applications. They are quite busy, so we must make sure that
users can easily request access to the platform with a simple onboarding
workflow.

We should also make sure that day-1 support is automatable so people can request
extra credits for their LLM application through a form instead of having to
contact IT services for support.

## Persona: Business Unit Manager

The Business Unit Manager at Info Support is responsible for approving costs.
They must be able to see how much they're spending in the platform. We should
make sure that we have the option to create a report for all initiatives within
the scope of a business unit and how much they're spending on LLMs.
