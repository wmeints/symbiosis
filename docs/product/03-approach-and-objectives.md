# Approach and objectives

This section covers the approach and objectives for the project.

## Objectives

### Objective: Provide a centralized environment to access LLMs

We see that providing a centralized LLM gateway with monitoring, cost
management, and proper access controls lowers the burden on teams to develop
high quality LLM-based applications while providing the necessary controls for
our internal IT operations team to manage costs and access to LLMs.

### Objective: Increase safety of our LLM based applications

Securing LLM-based applications is an important step for every team. But it is
also quite hard to get right. By providing teams with a standardized approach we
lower the burden to secure applications by sharing experience across
applications.

## Approach

While researching possible directions for a LLM application platform we came
across a growing list of products that can help us achieve the goals we
mentioned in the previous section. However, we also found that almost 100% of
the vendors behind these products are looking to sell cloud-based solutions with
a subscription model. All the tools we found were broken to a point where you
were forced to buy the cloud solution instead. This is not ideal.

Info Support is moving towards a more souvern approach when it comes to
cloud-based solutions. Also, we value open-source because it gives us options to
improve the software or to host it in other places.

Our approach to an AI gateway should be to build a pragmatic solution that
initially serves customers working on text-based solutions, expanding the
solution into image generation as the need arizes.
