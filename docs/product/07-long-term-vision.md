# Long-term vision

In the long-term vision for this project is to provide a solution that works for
us internally at Info Support but also works for customers that require a
centralized solution to manage their LLM-based applications.

We envision that we can expand the gateway to support other forms of content
beyond text, for example, audio and video could also be part of the gateway.
