# Product Documentation

This directory contains the product documentation for the Open Source LLM
Platform project. The documentation covers the strategic vision, business
context, requirements, and key decisions that guide the development of a
centralized LLM application platform.

The platform aims to provide Info Support developers with centralized access to
governance-approved LLMs while enabling cost management, security monitoring,
and proper compliance controls. The solution prioritizes open-source
technologies to maximize portability across cloud and on-premises environments.
