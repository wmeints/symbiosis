# Business context

In the business context not using a centralized LLM application platform will
cause issues with operational costs, risk and compliance, and development costs.

Here are some examples that we ran into before we started looking into an LLM
application platform solution:

- **Risk and compliance:** Microsoft throttled one of our application because we
  violated an acceptable use policy they have for their LLMs. Because we didn't
  have proper monitoring in place we were unable to debug why we violated the
  policy. Having a platform where monitoring is centralized prevents this
  scenario.

- **Increased operational costs:** We've seen application end up in very long
  chat sessions with an LLM because we didn't put the proper limits in place.
  This caused us to overspend quite a bit. With a centralized platform that lets
  us set budgets for applications we could have prevented this from happening.

- **Increased development costs:** We notice that because teams can't properly
  monitor the interactions with LLMs they take longer to create and improve
  applications. With a centralized monitoring solution we make it easier to
  debug LLM based applications so we can improve them quicker.
