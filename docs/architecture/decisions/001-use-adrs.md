# ADR001 - Use Architecture Decision Records

- Date: 2025-11-8
- Status: Accepted

## Context

We need to record decisions in the architecture for ourselves and for our coding agents. We want these decisions to be recorded in a consise format.

There are quite [a few formats
available][ADR_FORMATS]
which are sort of the same so we don't need a comparison here.

## Decision

- We choose the ADR record format proposed by Micheal Nygard.

## Consequences

- We can instruct our agents better in what they need to build.
- We can read back what we decided for important topics in the project.
