name: Backend Queries
description: Write secure, optimized database queries using parameterized statements, eager loading, and strategic indexing to prevent SQL injection and N+1 problems. Use this skill when writing database queries using ORMs like SQLModel, SQLAlchemy, Django ORM, or raw SQL queries. Use when implementing data fetching logic, query filters, joins, aggregations, pagination, or transaction handling. Use when working with repository patterns, data access layers, service layer queries, or any code that retrieves or manipulates data from databases. Use when optimizing query performance, preventing N+1 queries, or implementing eager loading strategies.

## When to use this skill

- When writing database queries using ORMs like SQLModel, SQLAlchemy, Django ORM, TypeORM, or Sequelize
- When implementing data fetching logic in repository classes, service layers, or data access objects
- When using raw SQL queries and need to ensure proper parameterization for security
- When implementing eager loading or joins to avoid N+1 query problems
- When writing queries with WHERE clauses, filters, or search functionality
- When implementing pagination, sorting, or filtering features that use database queries
- When wrapping multiple database operations in transactions for data consistency
- When optimizing slow queries by selecting specific columns instead of using SELECT *
- When implementing query timeouts or caching strategies for expensive queries
