name: Backend Models
description: Define database models and ORM entities with proper data types, constraints, relationships, and validation. Use this skill when creating or editing database model files such as SQLModel classes, SQLAlchemy models, Django models, TypeORM entities, Sequelize models, or similar ORM/ODM entity definitions. Use when defining table schemas, model fields, data types, foreign key relationships, indexes, constraints, timestamps, or validation rules at the model level. Use when working with model definition files typically found in directories like models/, entities/, or when editing files that extend ORM base classes.

## When to use this skill

- When creating or editing database model files using ORMs like SQLModel, SQLAlchemy, Django ORM, TypeORM, or Sequelize
- When defining model fields, column types, and data constraints such as NOT NULL, UNIQUE, or CHECK constraints
- When implementing relationships between models including one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many associations
- When adding timestamps (created_at, updated_at) to models for audit trails
- When defining foreign key relationships and configuring cascade behaviors
- When creating database indexes on model fields for query performance
- When implementing model-level validation rules and property validators
- When working with files in model directories such as models/, entities/, or schema/
- When balancing database normalization with practical query performance needs
