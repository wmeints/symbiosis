name: Global Commenting
description: Write self-documenting code with minimal, evergreen comments that explain complex logic sections without documenting temporary changes or fixes. Use this skill when adding comments to any source code files, when writing docstrings or JSDoc for functions and classes, or when deciding whether code needs explanatory comments. Use when refactoring code to be more self-explanatory through better naming and structure. Use when reviewing existing comments to remove outdated, temporary, or change-tracking comments that don't provide lasting value.

- When reviewing and removing comments that reference recent changes, temporary fixes, or TODO items
- When ensuring comments remain evergreen and relevant far into the future without dating quickly
- When deciding between adding a comment versus refactoring code to be more self-explanatory
- When editing any source code files where commenting standards should be consistently applied
