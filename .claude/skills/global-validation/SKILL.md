name: Global Validation
description: Implement comprehensive validation with server-side checks, early failure, specific error messages, and input sanitization to prevent injection attacks. Use this skill when implementing form validation, API request validation, data type checking, input sanitization, or validation logic at any application layer. Use when working with validation libraries, schema validators, or implementing custom validation rules for user input, API payloads, or business logic. Use when writing validation code in backend APIs, frontend forms, or data processing pipelines.

## When to use this skill

- When implementing server-side validation for API endpoints, form submissions, or data processing
- When adding client-side validation to provide immediate user feedback in forms or UI components
- When validating data types, formats, ranges, and required fields using schemas or validation libraries
- When writing specific, field-level error messages that help users understand and correct validation failures
- When implementing allowlist validation to define what is permitted rather than blocking disallowed input
- When sanitizing user input to prevent SQL injection, XSS, command injection, or other security vulnerabilities
- When validating business rules such as sufficient balances, valid date ranges, or domain-specific constraints
- When ensuring validation is applied consistently across all entry points including web forms, API endpoints, and background jobs
- When duplicating validation on both client and server sides for security and user experience
