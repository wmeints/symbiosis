name: Global Coding Style
description: Write clean, consistent code following established naming conventions, formatting standards, and the DRY principle with meaningful names and small focused functions. Use this skill when writing or editing any code files across the entire codebase including Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, Go, or any programming language files. Use when naming variables, functions, classes, or files, when refactoring code to remove duplication, when formatting code with proper indentation, or when ensuring consistent code style. Use when cleaning up dead code, unused imports, or commented-out blocks. Use this skill for all general coding tasks that require adherence to coding style best practices.

## When to use this skill

- When writing or editing any source code files in Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, Go, or other programming languages
- When naming variables, functions, classes, modules, or files to ensure descriptive, meaningful names
- When refactoring code to eliminate duplication and extract common logic into reusable functions
- When formatting code with consistent indentation, line breaks, and spacing using linters or formatters
- When creating functions and ensuring they are small, focused on a single task, and easily testable
- When removing dead code, unused variables, commented-out blocks, or unnecessary imports
- When ensuring consistent naming conventions across the codebase (camelCase, snake_case, PascalCase)
- When deciding not to implement backward compatibility logic unless explicitly instructed
- When reviewing code for style consistency before committing changes
