name: Backend Migrations
description: Create and manage database schema migrations with reversible changes and zero-downtime deployment support. Use this skill when creating, modifying, or reviewing database migration files such as Alembic migrations, Django migrations, Flyway scripts, or Liquibase changesets. Use when writing migration scripts that alter table schemas, add or remove columns, create or drop indexes, modify constraints, or perform data transformations. Use when working with migration files in directories like alembic/versions/, migrations/, db/migrate/, or similar database version control folders. Use when implementing schema changes that need to be backward compatible or when separating schema changes from data migrations.

## When to use this skill

- When creating new database migration files using tools like Alembic, Django migrations, Flyway, or Liquibase
- When modifying existing database schemas by adding, removing, or altering table columns
- When creating, dropping, or modifying database indexes for performance optimization
- When implementing reversible migration rollback methods or down migrations
- When separating schema changes from data migrations for safer deployments
- When working with zero-downtime deployment strategies that require backward-compatible changes
- When writing migration scripts that modify foreign key constraints or relationships
- When editing files in migration directories such as alembic/versions/, migrations/, or db/migrate/
- When implementing database version control and schema evolution strategies
