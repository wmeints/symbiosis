name: Backend API
description: Design and implement RESTful API endpoints following REST principles with clear resource-based URLs and appropriate HTTP methods. Use this skill when creating or modifying API endpoints, route handlers, controllers, or any files that define HTTP endpoints such as FastAPI routers, Flask views, Express routes, or similar web framework routing files. Use when working with API request/response handling, implementing REST resources, defining URL patterns, setting up API versioning, configuring HTTP status codes, or implementing rate limiting. Use when writing or editing files in API routing directories, controller files, endpoint definition files, or when implementing CRUD operations via HTTP methods.

- When defining URL patterns and API routes for new features or resources
- When setting up API versioning strategies in URL paths or headers
- When implementing query parameter handling for filtering, sorting, or pagination
- When configuring HTTP status codes and response formatting
- When working with nested resource endpoints or relationship-based routes
- When implementing rate limiting or API throttling features
- When structuring request/response payloads for API endpoints
