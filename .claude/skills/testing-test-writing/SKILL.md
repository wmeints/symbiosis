name: Testing Test Writing
description: Write strategic, minimal tests focusing on core user flows and critical paths during development, deferring comprehensive edge case testing until later phases. Use this skill when writing unit tests, integration tests, or end-to-end tests using frameworks like pytest, Jest, Mocha, JUnit, or similar testing tools. Use when creating test files, writing test cases for new features, mocking external dependencies, or testing critical business logic. Use when working with test files in directories like tests/, __tests__/, spec/, or test/ and when naming test functions descriptively.

## When to use this skill

- When writing minimal tests during feature development, focusing on completing implementation first
- When testing core user flows and primary workflows that are business-critical
- When writing unit tests using pytest, Jest, Mocha, JUnit, or other testing frameworks
- When creating test files in test directories such as tests/, __tests__/, spec/, or test/
- When mocking external dependencies like databases, APIs, file systems, or third-party services
- When writing descriptive test names that clearly explain what behavior is being tested and expected outcome
- When keeping tests fast (milliseconds) by isolating units and avoiding heavy setup or external calls
- When testing behavior and outcomes rather than implementation details to reduce test brittleness
- When deferring edge case, error state, and validation testing until dedicated testing phases
