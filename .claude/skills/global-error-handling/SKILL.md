name: Global Error Handling
description: Implement robust error handling with user-friendly messages, specific exception types, fail-fast validation, centralized error handling, and proper resource cleanup. Use this skill when implementing try-catch blocks, exception handling, error boundaries, input validation, or error logging and monitoring. Use when writing code that handles API errors, database errors, file system errors, or any failure scenarios. Use when implementing retry strategies, graceful degradation, or error recovery mechanisms in any programming language.

## When to use this skill

- When implementing try-catch blocks, exception handling, or error boundaries in any programming language
- When validating input data and need to fail fast with clear, actionable error messages
- When writing user-facing error messages that avoid exposing technical details or security information
- When using specific exception types (ValueError, TypeError, etc.) rather than generic exception handling
- When implementing centralized error handling at API boundaries, controllers, or middleware layers
- When designing systems that degrade gracefully when non-critical services or features fail
- When implementing retry strategies with exponential backoff for transient failures in external API calls
- When ensuring proper resource cleanup using finally blocks, context managers, or similar mechanisms
- When adding error logging, monitoring, or alerting to catch and track production errors
